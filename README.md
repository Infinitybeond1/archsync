# archsync

## You can run the scripts in the repository to get my version of arch linux. 

### main.sh
This script installs the main things such as the Paru AUR Manager, pamac (a gui for pacman), Librewolf - My browser of choice, ArcoLinux Spices (Which lets you use the repositories from arcolinux, such as spotify and many others), It also installs Discord, and PowerCord (a custom client for discord, but uses less resources than better discord), and finally it installs Kitty & zsh - My terminal emulator of choice
